    -Unchecked: All the classes under run time are unchecked

Checked exception example: IOException(resources like file, devic, network) manage with care
    Handle all errors that can occur.
    
Compile time exceptions: Checked Exceptions
Compiler is unaware of logic written
Classes under run time is unchecked by compiler, they are unchecked exceptions.
Runtime exceptions must be minimized by programmer

Error is unchecked and programmer need not handle these exceptions
 
5 exception keyword

UncheckedExceptions
Take inputs from the keyboard using io streams

Multiple catch statement rules
-all subclasses must come first, followed by the parent classes

Input stream object and methods help to read data from a file
Output Stream objects write methods to a file for permanent persistance


Java supports these two type
byte stream and character stream
input stream and output stream


Byte streams
File operations using Byte streams
    -single byte
    -byte array
    -object reading and writing
Implements serializable 
    -marker interface
    -has no interface but passes data to the JVM to serialize the object
Collections:
    -elements of a Collections
