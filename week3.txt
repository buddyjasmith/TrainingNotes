platform independent
converts code to byte code
    byte code can be localized to any platform
    JVM is platform dependent

Fundamentals
    ASCII is substitution of Unicodes
    token: 
    Identifiers: names of variables, objects
    Keywords:

    Concepts of data types:
    Programming is stored concepts:
    Primitive Data Types:
        -char 2
        -byte 1
        -int: 4 bytes
        -short 2
        -double 8
        -float 5 follow value with F, ex: 15.1F;

        -boolean 1 
    
Find largest of three numbers

Find average of three subject marks
    distinction <= 100 &&  >= 75
    first class <75 and > 60
    pass class < 60
Explicit:  (type)

Implicit: without explicitly casting typ 


Control Statements: Conditional/Logical || && !
Bitwise Operators: | & << >> ^

Reversal
int reverse = 0, remainder 0;
while(n > 0){
    remainder = n % 10;
    reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder;
    n = n /10;
}
Assignment: Convert number to binary
            Armstrong number: get length of number
                              cube each digit
                              add together
                              

                              Example:
                              1234
                              1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + 4^4, if equal to original number, armstrong number
