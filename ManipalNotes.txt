Major Elements Abstraction: denotes char of object 
Encapsulation:
compartmentalizing/hiding of data within object.
               serves tp separate
Modularity: divsion in to smaller modules
            cohesive and loosely coupled modules
Hierarchy: Single inheritance,
           Multiple inheritance, Composition, Aggregation

Minor Persistence: transcends time of existence.
             objects location moves from one location to next
Typing: enforcement of the class of an object, may or may not be interchanged
        early and late binding Polymorphism:

Concurrency


Abstraction: distinguishes an object from other objects
            denotes the essential characteristics of an object that
            distinguishes it from other objects.

            defines crisply defined boundaries, in relation to the user Suppress
            details that do not matter to the user.

            Abstraction of functions based on which user is using the object

Encapsulation:
    mechanism to restrict access to some objects Compartmentalizing objects of
    Abstraction Data binding.

Aggregation:
    Whole part relationship Object A belongs to object B - (Whole Diamond)
       * Object A is often called as constituted object, part, constituent, and
         a member object * Object B is the composite type Combines simple
         objects into more complex ones

    **HAS a relationship -Department has a Professor, prof can be independent if
    department is destroyed -Department may have 0 or more -Professor may have 0
    or more departments
inheritance
    B is an extension of Abstraction B is a subtype of A A is a Supertype of
    based B is considered an object of A Code Reusability
        Single inheritance: subclass inherits from one super class Multiple
        inheritance: Allows a class to have more than one superclass and inherit
        features from all parent classes 

        Hierarchical inheritance: Every superclass must have more than one 
                                 subclass
        Hybrid inheritance: combination of different types of inheritances
        Multilevel inheritance:
        subclass inherited by another class any number of levels

        To Override: same name, signature, etc..


Polymorphism:
    single interface, different entities

    Ad hoc: function overloading, different signatures
            Operator Overloading, not in java sneaky
    Parametric: allows a function to be written generically
                generics, templates
                " <> "
    Sub-typing: inclusion Polymorphism.  super-subtype
